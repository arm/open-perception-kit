# Edge AI Experience Kits CI Chain

## Overview

This repository uses a robust CI chain to ensure code quality, reproducibility, and platform consistency for all contributors. The CI system leverages Docker Compose and GitHub Actions to automate builds, quality checks, and tests across multiple platforms.
Each CI job runs in a dedicated container, ensuring a clean, reproducible environment. This way we can mitigate "this works on my machine" discussions.

## What does `.github/docker-compose.yml` do?

- Sets up the docker environment and creates easily accessible services for pek-ci

## What does `.github/workflows/pek-ci.yml` do?

- Runs the actual checks

## What does `.github/workflows/agent-review.yml` do?

- Runs Agent review on a self-hosted runner through the shared Python OpenAI Agents SDK runner
- Supports `workflow_dispatch` manual runs with a configurable `base_ref` input for the diff baseline
- Uses `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY_FOR_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNERS`, the Arm OpenAI proxy endpoint, and tracing-disabled Agents SDK execution
- Uses the checked-in review assets under `.github/agent-runtime/review/`
- Keeps static trusted Agent instructions in `.github/agent-runtime/review/instructions.md`
- Reuses shared helper modules from `scripts/private/agent_runtime/`
- Sets up the runtime venv through `scripts/private/agent_runtime/setup_runtime.py`
- Passes repository scope and bounded, sanitized PR evidence through a typed SDK
  run context; the model can access that data only through `get_review_context`
- Keeps the raw PR body out of the context artifact, Agent instructions, and
  constant runner input, and labels all PR-derived tool data as untrusted evidence
- Uploads `agent-review-out` artifacts, including the structured review context,
  raw JSON output, and summary markdown
- Treats `agent-review-out/review.json` as the canonical machine-readable review state
- Publishes a fresh PR summary comment for each run from the structured review output
- Publishes fresh inline review comments for the current findings without prior-state reconciliation
- Does not run on pull request label changes, so unrelated labels cannot overwrite
  the Agent Review gate check

## What does `.github/workflows/agent-stabilize-pr-on-label.yml` do?

- Handles the `agent-stabilize` pull request label only for current-PR Agent
  Review finding stabilization
- Calls the shared `.github/workflows/agent-stabilize-pr-worker.yml` workflow using the
  latest canonical `agent-review-out/review.json` artifact for the PR head
- Also runs when someone adds `agent-stabilize` to an existing same-repository
  PR, because the workflow listens for the `pull_request` `labeled` event
- Ignores unrelated labels and does not create an Agent Review gate check

## What does `.github/agent-runtime/` do?

- Stores Agent runtime assets only: instructions, prompts, profiles, dependency pins, and model/task config
- Does not define executable GitHub Actions workflows; those live only in `.github/workflows/`

## What does `.github/workflows/workflow-audit.yml` do?

- Runs a minimal dependency freshness report for external GitHub Actions used by repository workflows
- Compares the current `uses:` refs against the latest GitHub release/tag for each action repository
- Publishes one simple Markdown report and a lightweight JSON snapshot in the `workflow-dependency-freshness` artifact
- On pull requests, reruns only the report job so workflow changes can validate the same dependency evidence without opening repair PRs

## What does `.github/workflows/agent-repair-source-run.yml` do?

- Acts as the public manual entrypoint for source-run repair only
- Accepts a source run ID plus optional target branch, task reference, repair profile, and dispatch nonce
- Calls `.github/workflows/agent-repair-source-run-worker.yml` with inherited secrets

## What does `.github/workflows/agent-repair-source-run-worker.yml` do?

- Contains the core repair engine behind the caller workflow
- Resolves source-run metadata, downloads logs and artifacts, and creates `goal.md` plus the companion Markdown context files under `.agent-runtime/source-run-repair/`
- Feeds the collected failure state and any downloaded artifact context into the OpenAI SDK repair agent so the patch is generated from the report instead of from inline workflow logic
- Runs the same shared Python OpenAI Agents SDK path as `agent-review`, with the Arm proxy and tracing disabled, to generate the repair patch
- Opens a draft repair PR only when the source run belongs to a PR carrying the profile-defined repair authorization label, then applies the profile-defined rerun label so normal PR validation can run outside the repair creation flow
- The default repair authorization label is `agent-repair`; it does not trigger current-PR stabilization
- Stays orchestration-thin by delegating repo-specific helper commands to `scripts/private/agent_repair_orchestrator/` and shared helper pieces to `scripts/private/agent_workflow_common/`
- Does not dispatch stabilization or merge the draft repair PR it opens; `.github/workflows/agent-stabilize-pr-worker.yml` remains the callable worker for explicit current-PR stabilization
- Uses `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY_FOR_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNERS` for the OpenAI SDK step so the repair flow matches `agent-review`
- Supports the optional `EXPKITS_AGENT_TOKEN` secret so checkout, push, and PR operations can run under a PAT or GitHub App token instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## What does `.github/workflows/agent-stabilize-pr-worker.yml` do?

- Resolves the PR branch and latest canonical Agent Review state for that PR head
- Creates stabilization prompt context under `.agent-runtime/pr-stabilization/`
- Snapshots helper code and checked-in Agent assets under `.agent-runtime/agent-stabilization-helper/` before checking out the PR head
- Runs the shared Python OpenAI Agents SDK stabilizer only when the latest Agent Review recommendation is not `approve`
- Runs the configured validation command set and pushes one follow-up commit with `EXPKITS_AGENT_TOKEN`
- Does not create repair PRs or inspect source-run repair artifacts

## What shared workflow plumbing lives under `scripts/private/`?

- `scripts/private/agent_runtime/setup_runtime.py` owns OpenAI agent runtime venv creation and dependency installation for review, repair, and stabilization workflows
- `scripts/private/agent_repair_orchestrator/` owns source-run repair input resolution, context collection, repair prompt rendering, patch packaging, branch push, and draft PR creation
- `scripts/private/agent_stabilization_orchestrator/` owns current-PR stabilization context preparation, helper snapshots, validation, and follow-up commits
- `scripts/private/agent_workflow_common/` owns shared process, GitHub output, JSON, review workflow metadata, task-ref, validation, and branch-push helpers
- `scripts/private/github_pr_context.py` resolves manual PR refs for standard PR-context workflow_dispatch runs with one `gh pr view --json baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid` call
- `scripts/private/sonar_quality_gate_workflow.py` owns the Sonar API probe/report wrapper so the workflow YAML only wires inputs, artifacts, and environment

## What does `scripts/private/agent_runtime/openai_agent_runner.py` do?

- Provides the shared Python OpenAI Agents SDK entrypoint for review, repair, and stabilization jobs
- Sets the Arm OpenAI proxy base URL, maps `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY_FOR_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNERS` into `OPENAI_API_KEY`, disables Agents SDK tracing, and injects `truststore` before importing OpenAI libraries
- Resolves the model from `.github/agent-runtime/runtime/agent-models.json` by agent instance; workflow plumbing passes config paths, not concrete model names
- Resolves task ownership and limits from `.github/agent-runtime/runtime/agent-tasks.json`, then dispatches through checked-in task classes instead of embedding task-specific behavior in the generic entrypoint
- Runs from the workflow-local `.agent-runtime/openai-agent-venv` environment created by `setup_runtime.py` so Ubuntu's externally managed system Python is left untouched
- Writes structured Agent review JSON for `agent-review` and lets repair/stabilization agents inspect the repo, run validation commands, and apply minimal patches without owning branch or PR lifecycle operations

## What do the split `.github/agent-runtime/` agentic roots do?

- `.github/agent-runtime/source-run-repair/` stores source-run repair prompts and repair profiles
- The default repair profile lives at `.github/agent-runtime/source-run-repair/profiles/profile.json`
- The workflow dependency freshness repair profile lives at `.github/agent-runtime/source-run-repair/profiles/workflow-dependency-freshness.json`
- `.github/agent-runtime/pr-stabilization/` stores current-PR stabilization prompts and the stabilization profile
- `.github/agent-runtime/workflow-policy/` stores shared prompt policy used by both repair and stabilization
- Runtime task limits and default task-to-agent-instance mapping live in `.github/agent-runtime/runtime/agent-tasks.json`
- Keeps long review and constraint text out of the workflow YAML and Python helpers while letting profiles carry flow-specific policy
- Lets helpers generate final `.agent-runtime/source-run-repair/*.md` and `.agent-runtime/pr-stabilization/*.md` files on the fly at runtime, so callers reuse the same core without checking generated prompt files into git

## How do agentic workflow helper commands run?

- Repair workflows call `python3 -m agent_repair_orchestrator ...` directly with `PYTHONPATH` pointed at `scripts/private/`
- Label-triggered stabilization workflows call `python3 -m agent_stabilization_orchestrator ...` directly with `PYTHONPATH` pointed at `scripts/private/` or at the restored helper snapshot
- Output-producing helper commands write to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` through their explicit `--github-output` argument
- Stabilization uses `snapshot-helper-bundle` and `restore-helper-bundle` helper commands to preserve the helper Python packages and prompt/config assets before checking out the PR head, then imports that snapshot while keeping the working directory on the PR checkout

## Operational Notes

- Self-hosted runner workspace isolation and the `/work` ownership hazard are
  documented in [.github/ci/self-hosted-runner-workspace-isolation.md](ci/self-hosted-runner-workspace-isolation.md).

## Functionalities

- **Triggers:** Runs on pull requests, manual dispatch, and nightly schedule.
- **Branch and PR logic:** Only runs on non-draft PRs, or when the `run-pek-ci` label is added to a draft PR.
- **init-workspace:** Prepares the workspace and environment.
- **build-changed-applications:** Builds only the applications changed in a PR.
- **build-all-applications:** Builds all applications (nightly or manual trigger).
- **Agent Review:** A separate workflow runs Agent Review, uploads the generated artifacts for the PR, posts a fresh summary comment for each run, and publishes inline review comments for the current findings.
- **Ruleset sync:** A separate workflow applies the checked-in repository ruleset drafts to GitHub after they are merged to `develop`.
